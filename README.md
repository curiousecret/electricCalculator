Assignment 

The electricity consumption charge is easy to understand and calculate. It is measured in kWh (kilowatt-hours). The rate of an electricity bill varies. Suppose we have the following conditions for calculating the rates of electricity:

Power (Wh) = Voltage (V) * Current Â (A)
Energy (kWh) = Power * Hour * 1000 ;
Total = Energy(kWh) * (current rate/100);

 Thus, a calculator that calculate electricity rates per hour and per day based on user input of voltage, current (A), and current rate is developed by using html, css, php and Bootsrap 4.
